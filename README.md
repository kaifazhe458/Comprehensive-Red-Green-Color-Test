# Comprehensive-Red-Green-Color-Test
Red and green color blindness is partial color blindness, divided into red color blindness and green color blindness. Patients can't tell red from green. In our application, the picture is made of the same color, but the color points with different lightness and darkness are arranged into Numbers and figures, which can be easily seen by normal color readers, while the color weak or color blind patients can only see part of the pattern, or even cannot read it at all. Our test procedures are as follows: 1. Red color blindness test; 2. Green color blindness test; 3. Comprehensive test; 4. Analysis results. The data are for reference only.
